<br/>
This project is created as a simple web application to gain a first understanding of React. It generates an arbitrary array and the user can choose one of the well-known sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort and quick sort. At every iteration of the sorting process, the intermediate step is represented as an array and pushed to a stack representing all the intermediate steps. This stack is responsible for the animation displaying how each sorting algorithm operates in each iteration. The user can change the speed of how fast the animation frames are displaying and can change the size of the generated array.

Quite a simple application, but it was fun to give me an insight into how React works. Created this project in my second year as a Computer Science sophomore student as independent work outside of my course work.
