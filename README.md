<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<div align="center">
Note: I am currently actively working on this application, it is under maintenance. Many features are currently not implemented yet and the text below gives an indication about the current roadmap of development.
</div>
<br/>
A Swift application written from scratch. I created this project to improve my skills on mobile development, Swift and implementing a frontend and backend together. This application shows my favourite Amsterdam hotspots (restaurants, bars etc.) in one app. The backend is created with a RESTful API and the data is retrieved in the Swift application.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
The backend database is run on my own localhost. This database is created using MongoDB, Express and Node.js. If you would like to run this own localhost use the commands below.



On [Postman](https://www.postman.com/cloudy-shuttle-469413/workspace/localguide/collection/11424816-580f89dc-9bd9-40c2-8319-d44eaef01f56?action=share&creator=11424816) I documented the CRUD operations with examples. The Postman `GET - Get all places` ([here](https://www.postman.com/cloudy-shuttle-469413/workspace/localguide/example/11424816-78bf1180-45ad-42bf-9685-dbe350dcf992)), includes an example showing all the JSON data that is also implemented on my own localhost. If you would like to run this application on your own environment, make sure that this is installed correctly to display the data.
